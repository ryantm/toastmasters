A song roasting toastmasters. I sung this as part of the 2014 Division Governor's roast

If I only had been trained

(Dorothy says)
Why, what would you do if you had been trained?

(Scarecrow)
I could wile away the year
Full of lots of cheer
I wouldn't be so drained
Distinguished I'd be gettin'
My clubs looking quite fetchin'
If I only had been trained

I'd travel to middle
Of Fresno without a quibble
Doing everything ordained

(Dorothy)
With the thoughts you'd go by
You could be another III
If you only had been trained

(Scarecrow)
Oh, I would tell you why
Oxnard 's near the shore
I could visit clubs I never visited before
And then I'd go and visit some more

My job would not be so hazy
I wouldn't have been as lazy
Club membership retained
I would toast and be merry
Denise's look wouldn't be as scary
If I only had been trained
